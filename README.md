# The Odin Project
This repository is a folder for referencing all my mini-projects from the 
[The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) course

The course consist of multiple smaller courses aimed at fullstack web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend and NodeJS or Ruby for the backend.
It is the best course on web development I have taken so far, with plenty of extra resources going in-depth, great examples and a helpful community.
